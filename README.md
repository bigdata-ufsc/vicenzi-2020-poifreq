# Exploring frequency-based approaches for efficient trajectory classification

Source code of the paper Exploring frequency-based approaches for efficient trajectory classification, published in ACMSAC.


There are two source codes that do the same thing, one implemented in Java and the other in Python. We ran the scalability experiments with the Java implementation and the others experiments with the Python, which I prefer.

Each implemention has, in the respective folder, a example of how to run the experiment. The classification code is also avaible, inside the Python folder.

If you have any issue or difficulties, please contact me at franciscovicenzi@gmail.com.
